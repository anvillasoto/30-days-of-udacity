D01:
----------
I am really glad to say that on this day, I received my specialization certificate for the Advanced Data Science with IBM through Coursera. I polished my Architectural Decisions Document for the project that I did entitled ECG Heartbeat Categorization Prediction Project as well as uploaded my presentation video. All of which are part of the Advanced Data Science Capstone before receiving the specialization certificate.

This is my first day actually working on the challenge due to Christmas break. Now I am ready to participate. I hope it is not too late.
