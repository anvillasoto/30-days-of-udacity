Milestones:
1. Rewatched the videos from Lesson 3: The Model Optimizer and implemented again the exercises from it. 
2. Read the article from Towards Data Science Medium post entitled [What is the Best Programming Language for Machine Learning?](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-the-best-programming-language-for-machine-learning-a745c156d6b7). As a JavaScript developer by profession, I am surprised that a significant amount of professionals use JS to their daily ML tasks. Although most of my trainings for AI and ML are in Python, I am really excited to be in a programming language-agnostic world since as the article would say, there is no best programming language for AI. That, like any other CS problems to solve, depends on the use case.

Milestones:
1. Finished the second half of lesson 3: The Model Optimizer. This is a lot for me to take in so I probably need to review this lesson once more before going to lesson 4.
2. Attended my first meeting for this challenge with my fellow #sg_spaic classmates. We talked about several project ideas as well as community initiatives.

Finished half of lesson 3: The Model Optimizer. This is getting really technical. I hope I can finish the whole module tomorrow. 

Another good news for me. I received my Acclaim Badge for Advanced Data Science Specialist that I acquired from finishing all the four courses in the Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization on Coursera.

Finished Lesson 2: Leveraging Pre-Trained Models

Here comes another good news. I applied last year to Bertelsmann Tech Scholarship Cloud Track. I got a rejection letter. But a month later, I got a confirmation that they opened slots for additional students and I got in. There are so many things to learn in a couple of opportunities that opened for me from Intel, Facebook and Bertelsmann. This year started with lots of surprises. I am willing to take the challenge.

Finished Lesson 1: Introduction to AI at the Edge

Another good news from Facebook. Last year, I applied for the Developer Circle Training Courses for the Quarter 1 of 2020. I chose the web development track since that is my current role and I want to further my skills in front-end development since that is the area that I think I am lacking as a full-stack developer. Two days ago, I got an e-mail sending me an invite to OpenClassrooms to learn ReactJS. This will take a significant amount of my time that are ought to be for this course but I am up for the challenge and I am really excited.

I am really glad to say that on this day, I received my specialization certificate for the Advanced Data Science with IBM through Coursera. I polished my Architectural Decisions Document for the project that I did entitled ECG Heartbeat Categorization Prediction Project as well as uploaded my presentation video. All of which are part of the Advanced Data Science Capstone before receiving the specialization certificate.

This is my first day actually working on the challenge due to Christmas break. Now I am ready to participate. I hope it is not too late.
